# EXL-EQ-2023
Our Team  **Forward Propagators (Vedant Pandey & Harsh Kumar)** was the **National Runner-Up of EXL EQ 2023**. We had to forecast the PM 2.5 level across 34 Indian Cities on 4 hours hourly basis based on the data provided and also identify the trends and patterns in the data. We explored different Time Series Forecasting ML Models like LSTM, SARIMAX etc., but finally choose Fbprophet as our final Model Building Tool.
We performed various operations on the raw data like Data Exploration, Data Cleaning, Feature Engineering, Data Visualization, Data Preprocessing etc.
