# EXL-EQ-2023
Our Team was the National Runner-Up of EXL EQ 2023. We had to predict the PM 2.5 level across 34 Indian Cities on 3 hours basis based on the data provided. We explored different Time Series Forecasting ML Models like LSTM, SARIMAX etc., but finally choose Fbprophet as our final Model Building Tool.
